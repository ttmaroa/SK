# REGRESSION(SKLEARN)

Looking at a real dataset about cars, we shall be looking at different car brands, their prices, type of engine they run on and among other characteristics that we shall be using in order to get some insight into our data.

After loading the data, looking at the descriptive statistics, we'll get to see that categorical variables don't have numerical descriptives and vice versa.

When dealing with visualizations, we shall incorporate the use of matplotlib and seaborn. This libraries come with extensive features that help in communicating our data effectively. We shall be using scatterplots, heatmaps as well as PDF curves to be able to get some insight into our data.

The PDF curves help us in a number of ways:

   -Understanding the distribution
  
   -Fundamental in statistical modelling
  
   -Identifying outliers
  
   -For comparing of distributions

During our analysis, we shall be checking for multicollinearity since we shall be working with multiple predictor variables. This can be achieved by:

   -Calculating the correlation matrix

   -Calculating the VIF of each predictor variable

   -Comparing eigen values

   -Calculating the tolerance statistic for each predictor variable

   -Visual inspection of scatterplots.

During our analysis, we shall be applying log transformation to the values in our dataset. What this helps us achieve is:

  -Handling skewed data

  -Stabilizing variance

  -Interprating multiplicative relationships

  -Removing outliers
